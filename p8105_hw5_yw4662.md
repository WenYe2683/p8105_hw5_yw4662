## Problem 1

``` r
# Function to check if a group shares a birthday
has_duplicate_bday <- function(n_people) {
  bdays <- sample(1:365, size = n_people, replace = TRUE)
  any(duplicated(bdays))
}

# Repeat the experiment many times
simulate_bdays <- function(n_people, n_sim = 10000) {
  mean(replicate(n_sim, has_duplicate_bday(n_people)))
}

# Apply to group sizes 2-50
results_bday <- tibble(
  n = 2:50,
  prob_shared = map_dbl(n, simulate_bdays)
)

# Plot
results_bday %>%
  ggplot(aes(n, prob_shared)) + 
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.1, color = "#0057A8") + 
  geom_point(color = "#0057A8") + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + 
  labs(
    title = "Probability that at least two people share a birthday",
    x = "Group size",
    y = "Probability"
  )
```

### Interpretation

The plot shows how the probability of at least two people sharing a
birthday increases as group size grows. For very small groups (fewer
than 10 people), the probability is low, meaning that shared birthdays
are rare. However, the curve rises quickly and non-linearly. Around
22-23 people, the probability crosses 50%, meaning that once a room has
more than 23 people, a shared birthday is more likely than not. By 50
people, it is over 95%.

Overall, the plot illustrates how counterintuitive the birthday problem
is: even moderate-sized groups have a surprisingly high chance of
sharing a birthday, despite there being 365 possible days.
